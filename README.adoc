This project is a {uri-middleman}[Middleman] project template pre-configured with the {uri-middleman-asciidoc}[Middleman AsciiDoc extension].

== Prerequisites

To use this template, you need {uri-ruby}[Ruby] >= 2.2 (command: `ruby`), git (command: `git`), and the Middleman CLI (command: `middleman`) installed.

You don't need to clone this repository.
The Middleman CLI does that for you (which is why you need git installed).

Middleman is built with Ruby, so the first software you'll need to install is Ruby.
We strongly recommend using {uri-rvm}[RVM] to manage your Ruby installation.

The next software you'll need is the Middleman CLI, which provides the `middleman` command.
To install the Middleman CLI, run the following command:

 $ gem install middleman-core middleman-cli
 
Now that you've got the `middleman` command, let's put it to use!

== Usage

To start, create a new folder for your site, then switch to it:

 $ mkdir mysite
   cd mysite

Now you can use the Middleman CLI to initialize a new Middleman project from this template:

 $ middleman init -T opendevise/middleman-templates-asciidoc -B

NOTE: We've deferred the call to Bundler (the `-B` switch) to give ourselves more control over where gems are installed.
We prefer to install gems into the current project.

Now initialize your project in the normal way using Bundler:

 $ bundle --path=.bundle/gems

Now you can preview your site using the `middleman` command.

 $ bundle exec middleman
